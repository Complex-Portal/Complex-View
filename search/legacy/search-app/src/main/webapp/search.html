<h3>
Intact Search Application</h3>

<ol>
<h4>
1) Basi<a NAME="search.Overview"></a>c Overview</h4>
The search application currently allows a text-based search by entering
a text string into the search text box. It is possible to obtain information
on experiments, protein interactions and the proteins themselves, with
various views used to display the data. Intact uses the concept of short
label which is intended to provide a way of 'more memorable identification'
compared to a standard Accession Number (AC), although searches by AC are
obviously allowed. For example a particular Experiment may have an AC of
EBI-14, but its short label is 'gavin' indicating a more meaningful reference
to the physical experiment which the entry represents. Basic points on
usage:</ol>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Wildcard searching is supported - for example matches will be retrieved
for strings such as EBI*, *BI-14, E*4, etc etc.</li>

<li>
upper or lower case strings are acceptable and will be matched if they
exist</li>

<li>
currently searches progress in a certain order: proteins, then interactions,
then experiments. At a lower level, specific attributes are searched by
AC, short label, Xref primary ID and finally full name. This algorithm
may change as the intact project matures.</li>

<li>
Note that whilst CvObject details can be displayed via the click of a link,
currently it is not possible to search for CvObjects via the text box search
entry point.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>

<h4>
Definition of Table Items</h4>
The items displayed in the above table format have the following descriptions:
<p><a NAME="search.ac"></a><b>AC</b> - The Accession Number of the Experiment,
Interaction etc.
<p><a NAME="search.ShortLabel"></a><b>ShortLabel</b> - a 'more memorable' way
of identifying the Experiment, Interaction etc other than by its AC. A
short label should be unique within particular classes of objects (for
example within CvTopics) but in general they may not be.
<p><a NAME="FullName"></a><b>full name</b> - the complete name of the Interaction,
Protein etc (eg ????)
<p><a NAME="search.CvInteraction"></a><b>CvInteraction</b> - a link to a page
displaying the controlled vocabulary information for the term 'Interaction'
<p><a NAME="CvIdentification"></a><b>CvIdentification</b> - a link to the
controlled vocabulary information for the means of identifying an item
(eg ???)
<p><a NAME="search.BioSource"></a><b>BioSource</b> - the biological source of
the interaction information (eg the organism it was observed in)
<p><a NAME="Comment"></a><b>Comment</b> - annotation text, usually split
into categories of annotation topic,&nbsp; describing further details of
the interaction, experiment etc.
<p><a NAME="search.XrefDb"></a><b>xref database</b> - a link to the information
describing a cross-reference in another database (eg swissprot, GO etc)
<p><a NAME="search.XrefPrimaryId"></a><b>primaryId</b> - the original source of information
<p><a NAME="search.XrefSecondId"></a><b>secondaryId</b> - ???
<p><a NAME="search.DbRelease"></a><b>DbRelease</b> - the version of the cross-reference
database that the data relates to
<p>There is also:
<br><a NAME="search.ProteinList"></a>A row listing the short labels of the proteins
involved in a particular interaction - each short label has a link to the
controlled vocabulary describing the role that the protein plays in this
interaction (see below). Each short label is a link to more detailed data
on a particular protein.
<p>In addition to these there are a number of other items which may be
displayed in various views, particularly with respect to interaction data:
<p><a NAME="search.CvComponentRole"></a><b>CvComponentRole</b> - a link to the
controlled vocabulary information describing the role that an interactor
plays in the interaction (eg for a protein it may have a role of 'bait'
or 'prey' in a 2-hybrid experiment)
<p><a NAME="search.CvInteractionType"></a><b>CvInteractionType</b> - a link to
the controlled vocabulary information describing the type of interaction
observed (eg ???)
<p><a NAME="search.Stoichiometry"></a><b>Stoichiometry</b> - a numberical value
attributed to a component of an interaction, signifying ?????
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="search.ResultsExample"></a>Searching for interactions, proteins or
experiments typically results in the same view - a table detailing all
the interactions for a particular experiment, with the short labels listed
of the proteins involved in the interactions. An example result screen
is shown below:
<p><img SRC="images/imageV3F.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<p><a NAME="search.ExampleProteinView"></a>An example result view from clicking
on a Protein link is shown below:
<p><img SRC="images/image23F.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="search.ExampleCvView"></a>If for example in the above screen you click
on 'SPTR', this will display the controlled vocabulary information for
the database identified with a short label of 'SPTR'. The screen looks
like this:
<p><img SRC="images/imageE0A.JPG" height=768 width=1024>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="search.ShortLabelHelp"></a>Protein short labels are links you can
click to get a view of the protein details. Also each protein short label
has a term in brackets (eg '[p]') which denotes the role that the protein
plays in the interaction. These terms have tooltips associated with them
to display the role name, and also the term is a clickable link from which
you can view the full details of the controlled vocabulary term which presents
the controlled vocabulary information for that term (eg the details held
to define the meaning of the term 'bait').
<p>Since the items displayed for a search result include many items not
actually queried for, the items that matched the oringinal search string
are highlighted in <b><i>bold italic</i></b> - there is even a helpful
little message at the top of the results page to remind you of this. Specifically
the *short labels* of the matching items are highlighted, since these are
always displayed in every view.
<p>Where a protein (for example) might actually occur more than once in
an experiment, the display is rationalised to avoid multiple presentations
of the same experiment - therefore all occurrences within an experiment
are gathered together into one experiment view.
<p><a NAME="search.ButtonDefinition"></a>At the bottom of the page are a number
of buttons:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
a button to view the full details of what is on the results page (this
expands all the information currently on the page, apart from the controlled
vocabulary details);</li>

<li>
a reset button to uncheck any textboxes;</li>

<li>
a graph button to display a graph of any selected proteins, which can be
chosen by clicking the appropriate checkboxes.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<a NAME="search.ExamplDetailView"></a>Clicking on the 'Detail View' button expands
all protein details - a partial view of an example resulting page is shown
below:
