README for CvEdit (intactCore/application/cvedit)
**********************************************************************

DIRECTORIES:
/ (root)        : JSP and css files.
WEB-INF/lib     : Library files for web. All the files in this location are
                  included in the WAR file.
WEB-INF/classes : CvEdit specific (non Intact core) class files.
WEB-INF/tld     : The tag libraries.
WEB-INF/config  : Configuration/Property files for the application.
dist/           : Where the WAR file is created.

INSTALLATION
    edit repository.xml and OJB.properties in the intact root directory
    (intactCore/config) to suit your requirements (oracle vs postgres etc).
    Instead of editing these files manually, you may just run ant set-target-env
    from intactCore directory. The target environment is specified in the
    build.properties file (intactCore directory). CvEdit has been tested
    under Oracle 8.1.6 and PostGres 7.2 (local and remote).

MAKE IT WORK UNDER TOMCAT

    To make it work under tomcat you have two solutions :
        1. you can build the war file and deploy the application into Tomcat file
        architecture directory.
        2. modify the server.xml file of Tomcat in order to tell him to point at the
        temp-web directory under intactCore/application/editor directory

    If you choose the second solution you will not have to re-deploy the application
    each time you do a modification into the code. You will just have to compile the
    code which automatically put the new class files in this temp-web directory.


FIRST SOLUTION

    Go under the /intactCore/application/editor directory and type "ant war deploy"
    This will automatically create the war file and copy it under the
    CATALINA_HOME\webapps\app-dir (CATALINA_HOME is the directory where you have
    installed Tomcat)

SECOND SOLUTION
    TOMCAT 4
        Open the xml file called server.xml in CATALINA_HOME/conf and add the following
        lines :
        <Context path="/intact/editor"
         docBase="/homes/smudali/intact/intactCore/application/editor/temp-web"
         debug="0"
         reloadable="true"
         />
         Those lines should be at the good place in the server.xml file, i.e. with
         the other "Context" declaration

    TOMCAT 5
        Use the Tomcat Web Application Manager and in the text area "XML configuration
        file URL" put the URL corresponding to the intactCore/application/editor/temp-web
        directory. This URL should looks like : "file:/C:/intactCore/application/editor/temp-web".
        Then deploy the application.

SOME USEFULL COMMAND
    BUILD
        ant war
            prepares a WAR file to be deployed in a WEB container. The WAR file is
            created in the dist/ directory.

    OTHER USEFUL COMMANDS
        ant deploy (Tomcat specific)
            deploys the WAR file in the dist/ location to the CATALINA_HOME/webapps. The
            environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for this command to work
            correctly.

        ant undeploy (Tomcat specific)
            reverses the effects of 'ant deploy' command. In addition to that, this
            command also stops the WEB server (Tomcat) if it is running. As with
            deploy command, the environment variable CATALINA_HOME must be set for
            this command to work correctly. An error message, displayed when trying
            to shutdown the WEB server if it is not running, can be safely ignored. In
            addition to removing the WAR file, this command also removes the
            expanded directory as well. For example, CATALINA_HOME/webapps/cvedit
            directory is removed in addition to CATALINA_HOME/webapps/cvedit.war file.

        ant undeploy war deploy (Tomcat specific)
            runs all three targets in the specified order. Undeploys the last deployment,
            creates a new war file and deploy it again.

        ant war-test
            Not fully implemented yet. The purpose of this command is to create a WAR
            file for testing. Other similar command, deploy-test and undeploy-test, are
            also partially implemented.

        ant generate-struts-xml
            Generates struts-config.xml and validation.xml files. To use this target
            you must define an environment variable XDOCLET_HOME. This environment variable
            must point to the xdoclet installation. Visit
            http://xdoclet.sourceforge.net/xdoclet/index.html for more info on xdoclet
   
    NOTES
        The WAR file is being built using jar and class file from various locations.
        Given below are locations where it looks for these files:
            / (root)        - jsp and css files.
            WEB-INF/        - web.xml, struts-config.xml files and tld libraries.
            WEB-INF/lib     - all the jar files in this location.
            ../../dist/     - intact-core.jar file.
            ../lib          - struts specific common jar files.
            ../../lib       - application common jar files (only a subset).
            WEB-INF/classes - CvEdit class files.
