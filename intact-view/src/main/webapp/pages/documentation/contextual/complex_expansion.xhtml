    <h1>Binary interactions generated by co-complex expansion"</h1>

    <h2>Why should you care about complex expansion ?</h2>

    Some experimental methods such as Tandem Affinity Purification do generate molecular interactions that
    can involve more than 2 molecules. Despite the fact that IntAct curation team do capture the molecular
    interaction as they were reported in the corresponding experimen, when you search using the intact web
    site, the results of your query is always shown as set of binary interactions (i.e. 2 molecules). We
    would like to draw your attention on the fact that whenever the reported interaction was a co-complex
    we do apply an expansion algorithm that transform this n-ary interaction into a set of binary
    interaction. While none of these agorithms is perfect and will very likely generate some false positive
    interactions, it is useful to present the data in a consistent manner. Bear in mind that we will strive
    to differentiate in the search results which interactions are a real experimental binary from expanded
    ones.

    <h2>Existing expansion algorithm</h2>

    There are several known algorithm allowing to transform an n-ary interaction into a set of binary. The
    illustration below present the two well known expansion model and illustrates why they can be incorrect.

    <ul>
        <li><b>Spoke expansion</b>: Links the bait molecule to all prey molecules.
            If N is the count of molecule in the complex, it generated N-1 binary interactions.
        </li>
        <li><b>Matrix expansion</b>: Links all molecule to all other molecule present in the complex.
            If N is the count of molecule in the complex, it generated (N*(N-1))/2 binary interactions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br/>

    Now the issue (as illustrated at the bottom right of the diagram above) with these two models lies in
    the fact that the real complex might not be articulated around the experimental bait but instead, this
    bait might be linked to a smaller complex, hence most binary interaction generated by spoke and matrix
    expansion result in false positive.
