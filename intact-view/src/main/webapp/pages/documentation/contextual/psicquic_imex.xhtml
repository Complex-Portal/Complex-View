            <h2>What is the significance of the IMEx dataset?"</h2>

             <div style="padding:5px">
                <p>

                    is a network of databases which have agreed to supply a non-redundant set of data expertly manually annotated to the same consistent detailed standard which,
                    as such, represents a high-quality subset of the data each individually provides. The number of databases providing data may vary,
                    depending on the status of their services and only those that are active are used in this query. By clicking on the number of interactions you will be redirected to the
                    IMEx View, where you can browse the results in those other resources.
                 </p>
                 <p>The services currently active are:
                    <ul>
                        <ui:repeat var="service" value="#{searchBean.imexServices}">
                            <li><h:outputLink target="_blank" value="#{service.organizationUrl}">#{service.name}</h:outputLink></li>
                        </ui:repeat>
