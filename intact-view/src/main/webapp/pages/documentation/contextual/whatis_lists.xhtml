    <h2>Using molecule Lists (List tab)</h2>
    <p>This tab will show the list of molecules involved in the currently selected
    set of interactions by interactor type. Further operations are available from
    each sub-type’s tables. However, should you need to display the whole list at
    once, you can do so by selecting the corresponding option in the drop down list
    placed at the top right hand side of the table.</p>

    <br/> <br/>

    <h3>Linking a selected set of molecules to third party resources</h3>
    <p>You can select a subset of the currently displayed molecules by using
    the tick boxed and then click one of the buttons placed in the table
    header to open third party resources (similarly to the ones already
    showed in the Browse tab).</p>

    <br/> <br/>

    <h3>Building a new interaction set based on a selection of molecules</h3>
    <p>Furthermore, you can also search all interactions involving your selected
    molecule by clicking the ‘Search interactions’ button. </p>
