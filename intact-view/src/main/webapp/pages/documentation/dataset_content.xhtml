<p>Curated datasets are publications tagged, either computationally or manually by a curator, as being relevant to a specific area of biology.
    These are actively maintained andÂ grow with every release.
    <br/>
    New datasets can be requested, if relevant to your work, by mailing intact-help@ebi.ac.uk.

            This dataset contains interactions which have been derived in the
            context of the EU Affinomics project (Grant number 241481). This
            comprises interactions directly submitted by the consortium partners as
            well as interaction derived from the literature. The current focus is on
            interactions derived by Proximity Ligation Assay (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/?termId=MI:0813" target="_blank">MI:0813</a>), a method
            pioneered by the group of consortium partner Ulf Landegreen.

            A collection of interactions relating to proteins identified as associated with the cardiovascular system.
            These annotations create a PPI network which can be used to advance the understanding of protein interactions
            within the cardiovascular system. The gene lists have been assembled by the Cardiovascular Gene Annotation group
            at the University College, London and the dataset has also largely been assembled by that group, funded by the
            British Heart Foundation grant RG/13/5/30112, with the help of IntAct curators located at the EBI. This work is a
            collaboration with the Cardiac Proteomics and Signalling Laboratory at UCLA, funded by NHLBI Proteomics Center Award HHSN268201000035C.

            Cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. can be used as model organism as they undergo both oxidative respiration and photosythesis.
            Cyanobacteria have many features common to bacteria including a lack of compartmentalisation. This dataset is used to gather articles
            showing interactions relevant to plant photosynthesis, redox metabolism, resistance to metal and oxidative stress.
            Most interactors belong to Cyanobacteria species, with a focus on Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803), TaxID 1148,
            but some interactors belong to species where biological events seen in Cyanobacteria may also occurs like
            plants for photosynthesis. Also, the dataset contains a number of hybrid experiments using electron transfer
            between proteins from different species.

            The AfCS used high-throughput methods to detect protein-protein interactions between signaling molecules expressed in B

            this dataset are available <a href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/datasets/Synapse/misc/gene-names.csv" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Interactions made by orthologous proteins have been added manually by IntAct curators.

<h2 id="speciesDs">Species-based datasets</h2>

<p>Species specific datasets are generated from the protein-protein interaction data curated from peer reviewed
    journals and are available <a href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/species/">here</a>.
    The data are based on the taxonomy of the proteins taking part in the interaction.
    Analysis of one such dataset, which involved Arabidopsis proteins has been discussed in PMID: <a href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/22/4/997">20371643</a>.</p>
