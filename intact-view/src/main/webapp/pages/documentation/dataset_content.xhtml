<h1>Curated Datasets</h1>

Curated datasets are publications tagged, either computationally or manually by a curator, as being relevant to a specific area of biology.
These are actively maintained andÂ grow with every release.
<br/>
New datasets can be requested, if relevant to your work, by mailing intact-help@ebi.ac.uk.

<h2>Manually selected datasets</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Alzheimers</strong> - Interaction dataset based on proteins with an association to Alzheimer disease
        <p>
            The compilation of this dataset and its curation was carried out in collaboration with Perreau V.M. University
            of Melbourne, Australia. Interactions were investigated in the context of Alzheimers disease with a particular focus
            on APP (A4) protein. The articles to be curated were determined based on protein annotations and literature scanning.

    <li><strong>Cyanobacteria</strong> - Interaction dataset based on Cyanobacteria proteins and related species
        <p>
            This dataset was obtained in a collaboratice effort with Franck Chauvat, Corinne Cassier-Chauvat,
            Jean-Cristophe Aude, Magali Michaut, and Pierre Legrain from DBJC, CEA Saclay, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France.
            Cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. can be used as model organism as they undergo both oxidative respiration and photosythesis.
            Cyanobacteria have many features common to bacteria including a lack of compartmentalisation. This dataset is used to gather articles
            showing interactions relevant to plant photosynthesis, redox metabolism, resistance to metal and oxidative stress.
            Most interactors belong to Cyanobacteria species, with a focus on Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803), TaxID 1148,
            but some interactors belong to species where biological events seen in Cyanobacteria may also occurs like
            plants for photosynthesis. Also, the dataset contains a number of hybrid experiments using electron transfer
            between proteins from different species.

These datasets are computationally maintained but additional papers may be manually added to this set by a curator during the curation process.
When datasets are computationally added to a publication, the large scale papers (more than 100 interactions per experiment) are excluded.

<ul>
    <li><strong>AFCS</strong> - Interactions from the Alliance for Cell Signaling database
        <p>This dataset was obtained from the Alliance for Cell Signaling database.
            The Alliance of Cellular Signalling (AFCS) consisted of around 20 institutions which were engaged in a collaborative effort to investigate
            and understand cellular signalling networks (<a href="http://www.afcs.org/" target="_blank">http://www.afcs.org/</a>).
            The AfCS used high-throughput methods to detect protein-protein interactions between signaling molecules expressed in B
            cells and cardiac myocytes. The AfCS arranged a collaboration with Myriad Genetics to perform large-scale yeast two-hybrid
            screens. IntAct acted as a data repository of protein-protein interaction data generated by the AFCS project.</p>
