        <tr:panelHeader text="Using molecule Lists (List tab)" inlineStyle="margin-left: 10px; margin-right:10px">
            This tab will show the list of molecules involved in the currently selected
            set of interaction by interactor type. Further operations are available from
            each sub-type’s tables. However, should you need to display the whole list at
            once, you can do so by selecting the corresponding option in the drop down list
            placed at the top right hand side of the table.

            <tr:panelHeader
                    text="Linking a selected set of molecule to third party resources">
                You can select a subset of the currently displayed molecules by using
                the tick boxed and then click one of the buttons placed in the table
                header to open third party resources (similarly to the ones already
                showed in the Browse tab).
            </tr:panelHeader>

            <tr:panelHeader text="Building a new interaction set based on a selection of molecules">
                Furthermore, you can also search all interactions involving your selected
                molecule by clicking the ‘Search interactions’ button.
