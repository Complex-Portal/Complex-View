                Some experimental methods such as Tandem Affinity Purification do generate molecular interactions that
                can involve more than 2 molecules. Despite the fact that IntAct curation team do capture the molecular
                interaction as they were reported in the corresponding experimen, when you search using the intact web
                site, the results of your query is always shown as set of binary interactions (i.e. 2 molecules). We
                would like to draw your attention on the fact that whenever the reported interaction was a co-complex
                we do apply an expansion algorithm that transform this n-ary interaction into a set of binary
                interaction. While none of these agorithms is perfect and will very likely generate some false positive
                interactions, it is useful to present the data in a consistent manner. Bear in mind that we will strive 
                to differentiate in the search results which interactions are a real experimental binary from expanded
                ones.

                There are several known algorithm allowing to transform an n-ary interaction into a set of binary. The
                illustration below present the two well known expansion model and illustrates why they can be incorrect.

                <tr:image source="/images/documentation/matrix-spoke.png"
                          shortDesc="Spoke and Matrix Expansion Algorithm"/>

                <li>
                    <ul>Spoke expansion: Links the bait molecule to all prey molecules.
                        If N is the count of molecule in the complex, it generated N-1 binary interactions.
                    </ul>
                    <ul>Matrix expansion: Links all molecule to all other molecule present in the complex.
                        If N is the count of molecule in the complex, it generated (N*(N-1))/2 binary interactions.
                    </ul>
                </li>

                Now the issue (as illustrated at the bottom right of the diagram above) with these two models lies in
                the fact that the real complex might not be articulated around the experimental bait but instead, this
                bait might be linked to a smaller complex, hence most binary interaction generated by spoke and matrix
                expansion result in false positive.
