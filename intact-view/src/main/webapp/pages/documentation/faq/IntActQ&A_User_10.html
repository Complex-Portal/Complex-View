                                 It is a graphical way of representing a protein protein interaction network as a two dimensional graph structure. Within that graph, 
                                 the nodes represent proteins and the edges represent interactions. 
                                 </p>

                                 Type in the search form either a protein name or accession number and click the search button to display the related interaction 
                                 network. You are free to type a comma separated list of proteins in order to display all of them in one go. When querying IntAct to 
                                 display an interaction network, if the query is ambiguous (e.g. the query snu* could describes several proteins such as snu66, snu13...), 
                                 you will be automatically forwarded to the search application where you will be able to select the targeted protein(s) (as shown below)..

                                 To navigate in the interaction network, you can decide to change the current central protein. To do so, switch the mouse-click (sidebar) 
                                 behaviour to &#8220;center the view&#8221;, then, click on the required protein. The current interaction network will be reloaded with
                                 the selected protein as the central node.

                                 To improve the readability and the loading time, the default depth of an interaction network has been set relatively low. In order to 
                                 expand the current interaction network, by clicking the expand button in the sidebar. Bear 
                                 in mind that there is a minimum and maximum depth, the expand or contract button disappears when the maximum or minimum depth is reached.

                                 After loading an interaction network, a list of GO terms specific to the set of selected proteins is displayed in the top right frame 
                                 of HierarchView. By clicking on one of them, the related GO hierarchy appears in the bottom right frame (powered by QuickGo). If a 
                                 single GO term is found, the hierarchy is displayed automatically. Now you can select one of the displayed GO terms to highlight in 
                                 the interaction network all proteins annotated with that GO term in the IntAct database. These proteins will appear with 
                                 a differently colored label.  In the GO hierarchy, the lower the term (e.g. children of a GO term), the more specific, and the higher you go
                                 (the parents of a GO term), the more generic the GO terms become. Bear in mind that when selecting a GO term in the displayed hierarchy 
                                 all proteins that have parents of that term will also be displayed.

                                 bioinformaticians from a variety of backgrounds. Hence Cytoscape is well organised and well funded. The program can be downloaded 
                                 for free and is easy to install. One of the most exciting features of Cytoscape is the possibility to create plugins to customize 
                                 Cytoscape. The community encourage this and provide instruction on how plug-ins can be developed on their website. The website also 
                                 features a page of plugins available. For the purpose of using cytoscape with IntAct data

                                 developed with systems biology in mind and while interaction networks are certainly useful as stand-alone models such models can be of more 
                                 scientific interest when integrated with gene and protein expression data. Expression ratios/levels may be visually superimposed on 
                                 the network.

                                 Osprey is a tool for graphically representing biological interactions. Data can be imported from

                                 (General Repository for Interaction Data) or from manually curated spreadsheets. The datasets can be very large, shown below, is the 
                                 yeast-two hybrid dataset.

                                 Unfortunately (at the time of writing), the program does not allow for the import of PSI-MI data and thus is not of much use to 
                                 IntAct users. However, for analyzing data sets held in the The GRID it is a very useful tool, especially as nodes can be filtered 
                                 by Gene Ontology IDs. The picture below shows a dataset filtered to show only transporters.

                                 Pajek is another network analysis program. However rather than being designed to analyse biological data the authors of Pajek 
                                 have developed the program with study of social networks in mind. An advantage of this program is that it can convert from data 
                                 from spreadsheet style or plain text to a Pajek network file. The major disadvantage is that it cannot handle PSI-MI data and thus 
                                 is not recommended for analyzing IntAct data at this moment in time.

                                 PIMWalker&reg; is a viewer for protein-protein interactions map. It is able to display such maps as graphs where vertices are the 
                                 proteins and edges represent the known interactions between proteins. PIM Walker is able to read data from HUPO/PSI as XML files, 
                                 thus it is ideal for viewing IntAct data, as shown below. As it is designed exclusively for use with PSI-MI XML data, it contains 
                                 features which make use of the detailed annotation. By selecting a node (protein) or a line (interaction) the properties are 
                                 shown in the right-hand column. Individual proteins can be selected to be displayed from those loaded 
                                 from the PSI-MI file enabling specific parts of networks to be viewed. The program can be downloaded for free is easy to install and use.

                                 ProViz was developed with IntAct in mind thus it able to handle the PSI-MI XMl format and makes the most of the details the PSI-MI 
                                 format hold. Furthermore, ProViz allows for selecting of proteins by Gene Ontology Annotations. This enables proteins of similar 
                                 function to be viewed. A drawback is that the program is designed to run exclusively on the Linux operating system platform.
