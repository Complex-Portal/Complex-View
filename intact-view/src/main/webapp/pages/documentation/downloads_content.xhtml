    Curated datasets are publications tagged, either computationally or manually by a curator, as being relevant to a specific area of biology.
    These are actively maintained andÂ grow with every release.

        This dataset contains interactions which have been derived in the
        context of the EU Affinomics project (Grant number 241481). This
        comprises interactions directly submitted by the consortium partners as
        well as interaction derived from the literature. The current focus is on
        interactions derived by Proximity Ligation Assay (<a

        This dataset was obtained in a collaboratice effort with Franck Chauvat, Corinne Cassier-Chauvat,
        Jean-Cristophe Aude, Magali Michaut, and Pierre Legrain from DBJC, CEA Saclay, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France.
        Cyanobacteria like Synechocystis sp. can be used as model organism as they undergo both oxidative respiration and photosythesis.
        Cyanobacteria have many features common to bacteria including a lack of compartmentalisation. This dataset is used to gather articles
        showing interactions relevant to plant photosynthesis, redox metabolism, resistance to metal and oxidative stress.
        Most interactors belong to Cyanobacteria species, with a focus on Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803), TaxID 1148,
        but some interactors belong to species where biological events seen in Cyanobacteria may also occurs like
        plants for photosynthesis. Also, the dataset contains a number of hybrid experiments using electron transfer
        between proteins from different species.

        <p>This dataset was obtained from the Alliance for Cell Signaling database.
            The Alliance of Cellular Signalling (AFCS) consisted of around 20 institutions which were engaged in a collaborative effort to investigate

            The AfCS used high-throughput methods to detect protein-protein interactions between signaling molecules expressed in B
            cells and cardiac myocytes. The AfCS arranged a collaboration with Myriad Genetics to perform large-scale yeast two-hybrid
            screens. IntAct acted as a data repository of protein-protein interaction data generated by the AFCS project.

        <p>NDPKs, which play a major role in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates other than ATP, also possess other enzymatic
            activities and are required for cell proliferation, differentiation and development.</p>

            This dataset has been created for proteins-protein interactions involving at least one protein with an
            established link to the synapse. The list of human, rat and mouse gene names used for computationnally maintaining
            this dataset are available <a
                href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/datasets/Synapse/misc/gene-names.csv"
                target="_blank">here</a>.
            Interactions made by orthologous proteins have been added manually by IntAct curators.

<h2 id="speciesDs">Species-based datasets</h2>

<p>Species specific datasets are generated from the protein-protein interaction data curated from peer reviewed
    journals and are available <a href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/intact/current/psi25/species/">here</a>.
    The data are based on the taxonomy of the proteins taking part in the interaction.
    Analysis of one such dataset, which involved Arabidopsis proteins has been discussed in PMID: <a
            href="http://www.plantcell.org/cgi/content/full/22/4/997">20371643</a>.
