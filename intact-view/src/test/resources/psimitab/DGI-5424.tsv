Imatinib is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of Abl with Bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed Bcr-Abl. As this is now a continuously active tyrosine kinase, Imatinib is used to decrease Bcr-Abl activity."|mechanism of action:"Imatinib mesylate is a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the constitutive abnormal tyrosine kinase created by the Philadelphia chromosome abnormality in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukemic cells from Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Imatinib also inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF) - called c-kit. Imatinib was identified in the late 1990s by Dr Brian J. Druker. Its development is an excellent example of rational drug design. Soon after identification of the bcr-abl target, the search for an inhibitor began. Chemists used a high-throughput screen of chemical libraries to identify the molecule 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib."|comment:"drug absorption (MI:2045): Imatinib is well absorbed with mean absolute bioavailability is 98% with maximum levels achieved within 2-4 hours of dosing"|toxicity attribute name:"Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, dry skin, hair loss, swelling (especially in the legs or around the eyes) and muscle cramps"|comment:"plasma protein binding (MI:2047):Very high (95%)"|drug metabolism:Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4.
