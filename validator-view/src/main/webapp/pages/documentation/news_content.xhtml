    <h1>Validator news</h1>

    <h2>Version 2.2.0</h2>

    <tr:outputText value="In this new version, major bugs have been fixed. In the previous versions, some elements were never validated. It depended on the type of PSI-XML format the user choose to use (EX : experiments described within interactions were never validated. Experiments were only validated when the xml was of type 'compact')"/>
    <br/>
    <tr:outputText value="Now the validator has been refactored and is able to validate each element of the xml (xref, experiment, interactor, experimental interactors, interaction, organism, tissue, cell line, etc.)"/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <tr:outputText value="Several rules have been reviewed or removed because were irrelevant for MIMIx or IMEx : "/>

    <ul>
        <li><tr:outputText value="Interactor Name Rule has been removed. It is not mandatory to give a shortlabel/fullname to interactors. It can be autogenerated by the different database importers/providers."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="When a cross reference to a sequence database with a qualifier 'identity' is attched to an interactor, the sequence is not necessary. The info message to alert users when the sequence of an interactor is not present has been removed."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="For IMEx, the taxId -3 (unknown) and -4 (in vivo) are not accepted. The TaxId Host Organism Rule has been changed and doesn't accept such taxIds when the validation scope is IMEx."/></li>
    </ul>

    <tr:outputText value="New MIMIx rules have been added "/>

    <ul>
        <li><tr:outputText value="Participant's biologicale role rule : checks that each participant has a biological rule, it is required by MIMIx"/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Participant's experimental role rule : checks that each participant has at least one experimental rule, it is required by MIMIx"/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Interactor's organism rule : checks that each interactor has an organism, it is required by MIMIx"/></li>
    </ul>

    <tr:outputText value="New IMEx rules have been added "/>

    <ul>
        <li><tr:outputText value="Tissue's cross reference rule : checks if a tissue has a cross reference to BRENDA or Tissue List with a qualifier 'identity'. It is strongly recommended by IMEx."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Cell type cross reference rule : checks if a cell line has a cross reference to CABRI or Cell Ontology with a qualifier 'identity'. It is strongly recommended by IMEx. If no cross references are found, at least one primary reference to pubmed should be given."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Interactor's type rule : checks that each interactor has a valid interactor type, it is required by IMEx. If one interactor is 'nucleic acid' or 'small molecule', it should be removed from the file as IMEx is not considering such interactors for the moment."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Interaction's type rule : checks that each interaction has at least one interaction type and that all interaction types have a valid PSI-MI cross reference. It is required by IMEx."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Feature's type rule : checks that each feature has a valid feature type. It is required by IMEx."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Interaction's figure legend rule : IMEx recommends that each interaction has at least one figure legend."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Experiment's attributes rule : checks that each attribute attached to an experiment has a valid PSI-MI term and is recognized by IMEx as a valid experiment's attribute. Check the IMEx manual to see which attribute is accepted."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="Binding site rule : when a feature is a binding site, the size of the feature should be superior or equal to 1, otherwise it should be a mutation."/></li>

    <h2>Version 2.1.1</h2>

    <tr:outputText value="This new version has fixed bugs : "/>

    <ul>
        <li><tr:outputText value="Update of the PSI-XML library : the validator is now using psi25-xml 1.7.9-SNAPSHOT which fixed one bug of the writer (Not able to write PSI MI files having several entries in a same entryset) "/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="The Database cross reference Check was not looking at all the cross references (only experiment xRef, experiment Bibref and interaction Xref). It should also look at the interactor cross references, controlled vocabularies xrefs, etc."/></li>

        <li><tr:outputText value="One dependency of type interaction detection method - interaction type was wrong : When having ipac - association, it is not required to have than one bait."/></li>
