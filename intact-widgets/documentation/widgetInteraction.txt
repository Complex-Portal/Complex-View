Explanation of interaction of widgets:
--------------------------------------

To enable the widgets to interact with each other the public methods of both widgets can be used.
When a feature is clicked in the InteractionRepresentation widget the event "feature_selected" with the feature's coordinates is fired.
A listener can listen to this event and when fired, select the protein and the region of the feature in the Jmol widget.

The same thing can be done the other way round:
If a PDB file is selected in the Jmol widget the event "pdb_selected" is fired.
A listener can listen to this event and when triggered select the covered region of the PDB file in the InteractionRepresentation widget.


Examples for these functions can be found in the file widgetInteraction.js.
To bind a function to an event with jQuery use the following code:

$(document).bind(eventName, function(event, params){//do something});

e.g. $(document).bind("feature_selected", featureSelected);
